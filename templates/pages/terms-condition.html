              Returning a product for exchange or refund is free of charge as long as you return the products to

              on "return or exchange items" in the "your orders" section. Follow the instructions which will 
              allow you to:
              <br>
              - choose the articles to return as well as the reason for the return;
              <br>
              - download and print your pre-paid return label and a copy of your invoice.
              <br>
              If you are unable or do not wish to use the pre-paid label service, please contact Customer 
              Service who will record your return. You can then return your package to the following address:
               4th Avenue, 403 road Festac, Lagos Nigeria.
               <br>
              In this case, please insure your package for the full retail value of the item. DXD-SYNERGY will 
              not be responsible or liable if any item you return to the Website is lost, misdirected or 
              delivered late insofar as you have to bear the risks of the shipping you have chosen.
